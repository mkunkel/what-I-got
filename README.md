# "What I Got" on Rails
***

## Long story short
WIG is a home media inventory management system to help you catalog your books,
movies, music, games, and electronics -- including serial numbers on electronics
for insurance purposes.

## A little more about it
WIG is a Rails app utilizing PostgreSQL for its database needs. Users will be able
to add, display, edit, remove and (eventually) share titles from their collection as
well as search by title, author, genre and rating. This information will be accessed
from a easy web-based application.
